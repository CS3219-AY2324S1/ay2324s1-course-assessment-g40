# PeerPrep
### ay2324s1-course-assessment-g40

[**PeerPrep**](https://peerprep.yuanzheng.pro) is a platform on which users are able to prepare for technical interviews by matching with peers and practicing interview questions in a collaborative space.

The cloud deployment of [**PeerPrep**](https://peerprep.yuanzheng.pro) is available at https://peerprep.yuanzheng.pro. 

_PeerPrep was developed as part of **AY23/24S1 CS3219 Software Engineering Principles and Patterns** by Group 40 ([Chia Yu Hong](https://github.com/chia-yh), [Chinthakayala Jyothika Siva Sai](https://github.com/cjyothika), [Justin Widodo](https://github.com/GenFusion122), [Tan Yuan Zheng](https://github.com/YZTangent), [Xu Richard Chengji](https://github.com/itsrx))_

## Repository Structure
The main structure of the repository consists of three sub-directories, [`/frontend`](https://github.com/CS3219-AY2324S1/ay2324s1-course-assessment-g40/tree/master/frontend), [`/api-gateway`](https://github.com/CS3219-AY2324S1/ay2324s1-course-assessment-g40/tree/master/api-gateway), and [`/backend`](https://github.com/CS3219-AY2324S1/ay2324s1-course-assessment-g40/tree/master/backend).

Additionally, [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) workflows for configuring the CI/CD pipeline are located under the [`/.github/workflows`](https://github.com/CS3219-AY2324S1/ay2324s1-course-assessment-g40/tree/master/.github/workflows) directory, the [`/gke`](https://github.com/CS3219-AY2324S1/ay2324s1-course-assessment-g40/tree/master/gke) directory contains the `.yaml` files for deploying on the [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine?hl=en), the [`/question-fetcher`](https://github.com/CS3219-AY2324S1/ay2324s1-course-assessment-g40/tree/master/question-fetcher) directory contains files for the serverless function, and the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/CS3219-AY2324S1/ay2324s1-course-assessment-g40/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file for local deployment is located in the project root.

#### [`/frontend`](https://github.com/CS3219-AY2324S1/ay2324s1-course-assessment-g40/tree/master/frontend)
The `/frontend` sub-directory contains files relevant to the [Angular](https://angular.io/) frontend. This sub-directory has most of its config files under `/frontend/src`, while the rest of the files are under the `/frontend/src/app` directory. These files are organised as follows:
- `/_guards`: authentication and role guards on routes
- `/_helpers`: HTTP request interceptor helper
- `/_services`: `___.service.ts` files for handling different services
- `/<component>`: containing the `___.component.css`, `___.component.html`, `___.component.spec.ts`, `___.component.ts` files for each component
- `app` files that define the "root" of the Angular frontend

#### [`/api-gateway`](https://github.com/CS3219-AY2324S1/ay2324s1-course-assessment-g40/tree/master/api-gateway)
The `/api-gateway` sub-directory contains files relevant to the API gateway, implemented with [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/). It contains the `.conf` files necessary for configuring the API Gateway, as well as the `Dockerfile` for building the image of the API Gateway.

#### [`/backend`](https://github.com/CS3219-AY2324S1/ay2324s1-course-assessment-g40/tree/master/backend)
The `/backend` sub-directory contains files relevant to the microservices that make up the backend of PeerPrep. Each `/backend/___-service` directory is generally structured as follows:
- `/config`: the relevant config files, such as `db.config.js`
- `/controllers`: the `___.controller.js` files defining the methods used by the microservice
- `/models`: relevant files defining the models used by the microservice
- `/routes`: `___.routes.js` files defining the routes exposed by the microservice
- `Dockerfile`: defines how the image of the microservice is built
- `index.js`: handles startup and configuration of the microservice with the relevant files

The structure of each microservice may differ from this general structure in the case that some parts are not relevant to the function of the microservice.

#### [`/gke`](https://github.com/CS3219-AY2324S1/ay2324s1-course-assessment-g40/tree/master/gke)
The `/gke` directory contains sub-directories for deploying the API gateway and each of the microservices on the [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine?hl=en). Each sub-directory contains `___-deployment.yaml` and `___.service.yaml` files for deploying a Deployment and Service respectively. The API gateway additionally has an `api-gateway-ingress.yaml` file for configuring an ingress for routing external traffic into the API gateway.

#### [`/question-fetcher`](https://github.com/CS3219-AY2324S1/ay2324s1-course-assessment-g40/tree/master/question-fetcher)
The `/question-fetcher` directory contains the `function.js` file, which defines the serverless function that is deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 

## Deployment
**PeerPrep** supports both local deployment with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), for development and testing purposes, and cloud deployment with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (Frontend) and [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine?hl=en) (API Gateway + Microservices).

### Local Deployment
#### Requirements
- Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
#### Instructions
_To run the project_:
1. Ensure a Docker daemon is running
2. `cd` to the root of the project
3. In a terminal run:
    * `docker-compose up`, or,
    * `docker-compose up -d` to run in detached mode

The locally deployed **PeerPrep** may be accessed in a web browser at the URL [`127.0.0.1:8000`](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

_To tear down the project:_
1. In a terminal, run:
    * `docker-compose down`

_To elevate a user to an_ `admin` _role:_
1. Execute the following commands in the integrated terminal of the running `user-db` container (On Docker Desktop, go to "Containers" > "`user-db`" > "Exec"):
    * `mongosh`
    * `use user_db`
    * `var adminid = db.roles.findOne({name:'admin'}, {_id:1})._id`
    * `db.users.updateOne({ username: '<CREATED_USERNAME>' }, { $set: { roles: [adminid] } })`

(_where_ `<CREATED_USERNAME>` _is the username of an existing user to be elevated to an `admin` role_)

### Cloud Deployment
#### Requirements
- Set up a Google Cloud project
- Set up a cluster in the project
- Set up a repository in the Artifact Registry
- Set up a service account with sufficient permissions
    * _For reference, **PeerPrep** uses a service account with the following roles:_

    * `GKE_PROJECT`: the ID of the Google Cloud Project set up 
    * `GKE_SA_KEY`: the generated service account key for the service account with sufficient permissions
- Set up MongoDB Atlas account
- Under "Secrets & ConfigMaps" on GKE, configure a `db-admin` secret for the created cluster with `db-username` and `db-password` matching the username and password of the MongoDB Atlas account
#### Instructions
_Frontend Cloud Deployment:_
1. Log in/Sign up for Vercel, and add a new project from the homepage.
2. Under “Import Git Repository”, press “Import” on your GitHub repository containing the project. If the repository is not listed as an option, you can add it by clicking on “Adjust GitHub App Permissions →”.
3. At the “Configure Project” page, give the project a name. Choose “Angular”, and select ``./frontend`` as the root directory.
4. Click deploy. Vercel will now build the deployment and update it whenever a change is pushed to the repository.

_Backend Cloud Deployment:_

The instructions for configuring the deployment of the API gateway and the microservices to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) are as follows: 

1. In each `deploy-___.yml` file of the `/.github/workflows` directory, configure each of the `GKE_CLUTER`, `GKE_ZONE`, `REPOSITORY_NAME` as per the setup in "Requirements"
2. Configure the `image` in each of the `.yaml` files under `./gke` to point to the appropriate image in the repository on the Artifact Registry
3. Manually trigger the deployment workflows for each component under "Actions", or have them automatically trigger on changes to the relevant files

_Serverless Function Deployment:_

The serverless function is automatically deployed to the Google Cloud Platform on a push to the `master` branch. The instructions to manually deploy the serverless function are as follows:

1. Ensure that `gcloud` is installed. Run the following command in terminal:
    * `npm i gcloud`
2. Log in to Google Cloud Platform. Run the following command in terminal:
    * `gcloud auth login`
3. Login using your Google Cloud Platform account
4. Next, `cd`` into the function directory:
    * `cd question-fetcher`
5. Deploy the application using the following command:
    * `gcloud app deploy`
